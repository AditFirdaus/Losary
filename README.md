3rd overall winner of the 2021 Sayembara KKSI Game Development Competition as a Team with 2 members. I'm the project leader, and I'm in charge of determining the direction of the game being made. Most of what I do in this championship is design games and apply the maximum power of Unity in terms of graphics and performance by using good optimizations.
